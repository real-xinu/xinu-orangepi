This directory holds Xinu sources for the Orange Pi. This branch contains the multicore migration of these sources, which is a work in progress and is not guaranteed to be stable.

Note on Multicore branches:
-This branch contains (as of 11/2/23) all of the commits in multicore_migration_no_ethernet plus Ethernet and networking code from master that has been adapted to use multicore locking facilities. As such, this branch is the "main" multicore branch.
-As far as I am aware, the Ethernet code merge has not introduced any regressions or bugs that were not already present in multicore_migration_no_ethernet, but I have opted to preserve multicore_migration_no_ethernet separately just in case.
--The only exception might be that I uncommented the cpu_sev(); call in initialize.c/nulluser(), which is what actually unblocks the other CPU cores after init. multicore_migration_no_ethernet did not have this uncommented, so only 1 core was actually being used for processes there. Therefore, there may be regressions I am unaware of, but this will ultimately need to be uncommented for the multicore version to be useful.

Note on Makefile:
-If you freshly cloned the master branch or switched to it from a different branch and are getting compilation errors when running "make" from the compile/ directory, run "make clean", then "make" a few more times. Compilation will then complete successfully.

Note on Ethernet on the Orange Pi:
-The Orange Pi does not have a "true" MAC address embedded in the hardware - instead, it is up to the OS or bootloader to generate one at runtime. If you are using uboot to boot Xinu, uboot will generate its own MAC address, then Xinu will generate its own. If you have connection issues due to the randomized MAC, you can change occurrences of fetch_random_mac to fetch_linux_mac and change the bytes of the MAC to that of your uboot MAC address.
